        I finally decided to redesign my website. \
        To expand my skills with Swift, I decided to rebuild my portfolio in Swift.

        Additionally, I built a library called [swift-web](https://github.com/erikbdev/swift-web) which contains tools used to build \
        this website in Swift. It utilizes Swift build tools to generate typed asset generation, and \
        utilities to build a reactive website using Swift and Vue.

        Feel free to check out both projects on GitHub. ðŸ˜Š
