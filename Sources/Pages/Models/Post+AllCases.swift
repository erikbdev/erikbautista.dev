        content: """
          When I set up my Hackintosh, I couldn't control the RGB keyboard on my MSI laptop since the software was supported on Windows only. To fix this issue, my first approach was to build an app using AppKit, C++, and Objective-C to communicate with the HID keyboard, which was ultimately called [SSKeyboardHue](https://github.com/erikbdev/SSKeyboardHue).

          Later, I decided to switch the communication protocol to Swift and redesign the front end using SwiftUI.

          Both projects are available on GitHub â€” feel free to check them out!
